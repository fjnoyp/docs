Congratulations!  You've created a skeleton app and are ready to start adding Amplify categories to your application.  The following are some categories that you can start to build into your application:

* [Analytics](~/lib/analytics/getting-started.md) - for logging metrics and understanding your users
* [Authentication](~/lib/auth/getting-started.md) - for managing your users
* [Storage](~/lib/storage/getting-started.md) - store complex objects like pictures and videos to the cloud.
