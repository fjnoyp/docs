The Analytics category enables you to collect analytics data for your App. The Analytics category comes with built-in support for [Amazon Pinpoint](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint) and [Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis) (Kinesis support is currently only available in the Amplify JavaScript library).

## Goal

To setup and configure your application with Amplify Analytics and record an analytics event.

## Prerequisites

<inline-fragment platform="ios" src="~/lib/analytics/fragments/ios/getting-started/10_preReq.md"></inline-fragment>
<inline-fragment platform="android" src="~/lib/analytics/fragments/android/getting-started/10_preReq.md"></inline-fragment>
<inline-fragment platform="flutter" src="~/lib/analytics/fragments/flutter/getting-started/10_preReq.md"></inline-fragment>

## Set up Analytics backend

Run the following command in your project's root folder. The CLI will prompt configuration options for the Analytics category such as Amazon Pinpoint resource name and analytics event settings.

> The Analytics category utilizes the Authentication category behind the scenes to authorize your app to send analytics events.

```bash
amplify add analytics
```

```console
? Select an Analytics provider (Use arrow keys)
    `Amazon Pinpoint`
? Provide your pinpoint resource name: 
    `yourPinpointResourceName`
? Apps need authorization to send analytics events. Do you want to allow guests and unauthenticated users to send analytics events? (we recommend you allow this when getting started) 
    `Yes`
```

To deploy your backend, run:

```bash
amplify push
```

Upon completion, `amplifyconfiguration.json` should be updated to reference provisioned backend analytics resources. Note that these files should already be a part of your project if you followed the [Project setup walkthrough](~/lib/project-setup/create-application.md).
