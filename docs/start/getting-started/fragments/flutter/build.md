## What we'll build

In this tutorial you'll setup the Analytics and Storage categories of the Flutter-Amplify Library to create a very simple getting started app. 

You will use **Storage** to upload images to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). 

And, you'll use **Analytics** to track user actions in [Amazon Pinpoint](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/).
