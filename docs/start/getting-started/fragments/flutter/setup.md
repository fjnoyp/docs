ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! In this tutorial, you will:

- Download the getting started app
- Add the Flutter Library dependencies
- Use Amplify CLI to setup your AWS backend resources 

## Prerequisites

- Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) version 1.20.0 or higher
    
    These steps will also guide you through downloading and setting up Android Studio and XCode for Flutter.   

- Setup your [IDE](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio)

    This tutorial assumes you are using AndroidStudio to develop your app. 

- Install the Amplify-Flutter Developer Preview version of the [Amplify CLI](~/cli/cli.md) by running:

    ```bash
    npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli@flutter-preview
    ```
    An existing install of @aws-amplify/cli will not work, you need to install the flutter-preview version.


## Set up your application

### Create a new Flutter application 

1. Open **Android Studio**. Select **+ Start a new Flutter project**.

1. Next, configure your project:

    - Enter *todo* in the **Name** field
    - Make sure your Flutter SDK path is set correctly to where it is installed on your machine 
    - Press **Next**.  On the next screen, press **Finish**.

Android Studio will open your project with a tab opened to *main.dart*


### Add Amplify to your application

Amplify for Flutter is distributed via **pub.dev**.


1. Open your **app**'s `pubspec.yaml` and add the following 3 dependencies below the line "sdk:flutter". 

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  amplify_core: '<1.0.0'
  amplify_auth_cognito: '<1.0.0'
  amplify_analytics_pinpoint: '<1.0.0'
```

1. Run **Flutter Pub Get**

    Android Studio requires you to sync your project with your new configuration. To do this, you can click **Flutter** in the notification bar above the file editor.  

    ![](~/images/lib/getting-started/flutter/set-up-android-studio-pub-get.png)

    Alternatively, you can open a terminal window, cd into your project's root directory (where you pubspec.yaml is) and run: 

    ```bash
    flutter pub get 
    ```

    When complete, you will see *Process finished with exit code 0* in the output of the *Messages* tab at the bottom of your screen.
